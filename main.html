Hello world,
i am Iyiola Osuagwu, a problem solver Web Developer. Am adept at both back- and front-end development, with years of experience in variety of creating exciting projects. I am a good communicator with the ability to convey clearly. A good team player who thrives on creating solutions. Bacteria can be found virtually everywhere, including soil, acidic hot spring, radioactive waste, living or dead human bodies, and deep within the Earth crust. Animals live in a world much tougher than ours, it becomes a wonder how easy it is for a human to die under unfavorable conditions. We do not eat for a few days, we die. We stay somewhere too hot or too cold, we die. We fall from somewhere high, we die. We get too sad, we die. Our cats die, we die. Now, what has all this talk about bacteria got to do with the blog post title? it all start since i gave chance for technology to take part in my life. i was always ready to collect, take and ask. I remember when I first started learning front-end development. I encountered so many articles, and was so overwhelmed by how much material I would need to learn that I didnâ€™t even know where to start. i read a few blog post then everything started getting clear and meaningful, and then i can accross some really good materials and sites that could help improme me 1.DevDocs: API Documentation Browser DevDocs combines multiple API documentations in a clean and organized web UI with instant search, offline support, mobile version, dark theme, keyboard shortcuts, and more. and is Free and open source. let me show you how to save offline date in DevDocs. first log on to "http://devdocs.io" close to the search input feild there we can see a dropdown button ![Screenshot from 2018-04-14 12:48:33.png](https://cdn.utopian.io/posts/57d61b1db47e99fd1fab46d098a030d54606Screenshot_from_2018-04-14_12:48:33.png) now click the button, and we would be given a list of options all we need is to select the Offline Data (option), we should be redirected to a page that looks like this great now we can choose to install all or manually install one after the other Notice:we seem to have limited language option to install well see how we can Enable other language in a bit. great let see how we can enable other language options wen we hover on the list of options given to us, let say we want to enable C++ here is how we do it \ awesome we can also use the same procidure to enable other language like that(javascript, php) i think DevDocs is awesomely great and it could really help us advance our learning evironment. 2. ## Learn by Building (tutorials) we have billions of learning resource's online, the Question is what do you want to learn and how can it help you solve your problem.. some say watching tutorial video takings a lot of thier time, while some say its the best way to really learn. Reading Documentation and taking video tutorial for me is really the best,so when you get confused while watching a video,you can solve the problem by reading useful online documentation that could help you solve the bug or issue great, here are list of my great instructors 1.**Brad Travery**
